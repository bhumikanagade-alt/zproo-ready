ZPROO GO brings flights, buses, trains, hotels, cabs, bike taxis, holidays, parcel delivery and
corporate travel into one platform: a customer website, an admin panel, a REST + real-time API,
and a PostgreSQL database.

## What's included

This release is a working **flights and buses** booking platform, built Maharashtra-first
(Pune and Mumbai at the top of every list):

| Area        | What works                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Admin       | Admin panel with user management (other sections show "Coming soon")                                                                                                                      |

Other services in the navigation (trains, hotels, cabs, bikes, holidays, parcel, corporate, wallet,
offers) show a **Coming soon** page. The plan for them is in
[docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

> **Demo inventory.** Development uses built-in mock providers: fictional airlines and bus
> operators and a simulated payment gateway (no money moves; tickets are watermarked "not valid
> for travel"). Production refuses to start with these mocks — connect real flight, bus and
> payment (e.g. Razorpay) providers and an SMS provider before going live. See
> [docs/ENVIRONMENT.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT.md).

```

## Static website (no server needed)

The website runs **entirely in the browser** by default: flights, buses, sign-in, bookings,
payments (simulated) and tickets all work from built-in demo data, and each visitor's account and
bookings are kept in their own browser (localStorage). No API, database or Redis is needed.

```bash
npm install
npm run build -w @zproo/web      # → apps/web/dist  (upload this folder to any static host)
npm run preview -w @zproo/web    # or try it locally at http://localhost:4173
```

`apps/web/dist` includes routing rules for Netlify/Cloudflare Pages (`_redirects`), Vercel
(`vercel.json`), Apache (`.htaccess`) and GitHub Pages (`404.html`). For development with hot reload:
`npm run dev -w @zproo/web` (http://localhost:5173).

In the demo, sign in with any Indian mobile number — the one-time code is shown on screen. Tickets
open as a printable page (**Print → Save as PDF**). To use the real API instead, set
`VITE_DATA_SOURCE=api` and follow the full setup below.

## Getting started (full stack: website + API)

Prerequisites: **Node.js 22** (see `.nvmrc`), **npm 10+**, and either Docker or local PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7.

```bash
npm install                 # also generates the Prisma client
cp .env.example .env        # one .env at the repo root; set VITE_DATA_SOURCE=api
npm run db:up               # Postgres + Redis via docker compose (skip if running locally)
npm run db:migrate          # apply migrations
npm run db:seed             # roles, settings, demo users, flight timetable, bus network
npm run dev                 # web → http://localhost:5173, API → http://localhost:5000
```

- API docs (Swagger UI): http://localhost:5000/api/docs
- Health: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- In development the web app proxies `/api` to the API, and the footer shows a live API/DB/Redis status dot.
- **Signing in locally:** use any mobile number. OTP codes are shown on screen and printed in the API
  terminal (development SMS provider). Seeded staff accounts, e.g. admin **9000000002**, support
  **9000000003**, are listed in [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md#seed-data).
- **Try a booking:** search Pune → New Delhi on `/flights` or Pune → Mumbai on `/buses`, pick a fare
  or seats, sign in with any mobile number, and on the payment step choose **Pay** (or simulate a
  failed payment first). Download the PDF e-ticket from the confirmation page or **My bookings**.
- API tests use a separate `zproo_test` database, created automatically; Postgres and Redis must be running.

Deployment documentation arrives with the Docker and deployment phases (21–23).

## Railway (trains)

Train search, availability by class/quota, passenger details, review, payment, PNR status, cancellation with refunds, and live running status.
See `docs/RAILWAY_PROVIDER.md` for the provider contract (`TRAIN_PROVIDER=mock` in development; live IRCTC booking needs an authorised partner adapter) and `CHANGES-RAILWAY-VALIDATION-RESPONSIVE.md` for the validation/responsive notes.
New env vars: `TRAIN_PROVIDER`, `TRAIN_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS`, `TRAIN_PROVIDER_RETRIES`, `TRAIN_SERVICE_FEE_PAISE` (see `.env.example`).
After pulling, run `npx prisma migrate deploy` (new migration `20261012082509_railway_bookings`).
